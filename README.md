Vedur.is
=========

This is a simple python interface to get weather information from the Icelandic met office [Veðurstofa Íslands](http://vedur.is).


Dependencies
-------------

On ubuntu 12.04 I needed to install the following dependencies before I could install the
python libraries from requirements.txt:
	* python-dev
	* libxml2-dev
	* libxslt1-dev

Then just run:
	> pip install -r requirements.txt

assuming you use pip. Otherwise just make sure the python libraries listed in requirements.txt
are installed.
